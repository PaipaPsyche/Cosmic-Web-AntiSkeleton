### Abstract
We  compare  cosmological  simulations  of  N-bodies  with  the  results  obtained  by  Tully  etal.   (2014)  to  determine  the  shape,  mass  and  size  of  Laniakea,  our  local  supercluster. Continuing the work done by Hernandez (2016)  in determining the significance of Laniakea in these simulations,  we implement the Watershed algorithm to reconstruct and segregatethe superclusters.  We find that Laniakea is an atypical event in terms of shape, volume andmass in the framework of cosmological simulations.
